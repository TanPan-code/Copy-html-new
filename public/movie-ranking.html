<h1> My Best movies - MUST SEE IN 2024</h1>
<h2> These are the top 3 of my FAV movies</h2>
<hr/> 
<h3>Top Gun Maverick</h3>
<p> Its a movie starring Tom cruise. Where he is playing an expert pilot embarking on his last and probably the most important, mission of his carreer.</p>

<h3> Geek Girl</h3>
<p> Its a series... I liked it becuase of teh constant efforts the characters emabrks upon for self improvement instead of waiting for opportunities to be thrown at her. </p>
<p> Additioanlly, I liked the diverse array of characters embbedded with in the series. My favourite character was most definately was the gay one (sorry dont remeber his name)  </p>

<h3> Lincoln Lawyer</h3>
<p> another Netflix series... I know. But the mind of a lawyer and the visible impact he/she is potentcially able to inflict or curate through teh stages of his investigation and his ability to read people is truely ingenious</p>
